# Project Management API

A comprehensive project management system built with Next.js and Appwrite, designed to handle green hydrogen and renewable energy project data across multiple dimensions.

## Overview

This system provides a robust API for managing project information across five main data categories:

- **Projects**: Core project information and basic details
- **Project Compliance**: Environmental clearances and regulatory compliance
- **Project Financials**: CAPEX, OPEX, and commercial arrangements
- **Project Production**: Technology specifications and capacity data
- **Project Verification**: Carbon intensity and renewable energy verification

## Features

✅ **Complete CRUD Operations** for all project data types
✅ **Type-safe TypeScript** interfaces and comprehensive enums
✅ **Advanced Validation** with business logic enforcement
✅ **Flexible Querying** with pagination and multi-criteria filtering
✅ **Atomic Operations** for creating/updating complete project datasets
✅ **Utility Functions** for complex database operations
✅ **Project Analytics** with statistics and performance metrics
✅ **Carbon Footprint Tracking** and environmental impact assessment
✅ **Financial Analysis** tools and ROI calculations

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Complete Project

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/project-complete", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    project: {
      companyId: "company_123",
      project_name: "Green Hydrogen Production Facility",
      sector: "green_hydrogen",
      location: "California, USA",
      ownership_type: "private",
      start_year: 2024,
      completion_year: 2026,
    },
    compliance: {
      env_clearance_status: "approved",
      lca_completed: true,
      mrv_plan: true,
    },
    financials: {
      capex: 50000000,
      opex: 5000000,
      offtake_signed: true,
    },
    production: {
      technology_used: "pem_electrolyzer",
      electrolyzer_type: "pem",
      installed_capacity_mw: 100,
      hydrogen_output_tpy: 15000,
    },
    verification: {
      carbon_intensity: 0.5,
      renewable_source: "solar",
      additionality_proof: true,
    },
  }),
});
```

### 2. Retrieve Project Data

```javascript
// Get complete data by project ID
const response = await fetch("/api/project-complete?projectId=project_123");

// Get all company projects
const projects = await fetch("/api/projects?companyId=company_123");

// Search projects by criteria
const searchResults = await fetch(
  "/api/projects?sector=green_hydrogen&location=California"
);
```

### 3. Update Project Information

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/projects", {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    $id: "project_123",
    project_name: "Updated Project Name",
    completion_year: 2027,
  }),
});
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                    | Methods                | Description                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
